In this part, there are 2 topics that I learned: Lambda Function and OOP concepts using Python.

A lambda function is a small anonymous function defined using the lambda keyword. It can take any number of arguments but can only have one expression. Lambda functions are mainly used for writing short, simple functions in a single line, especially when passing a function as an argument to higher-order functions like map(), filter(), and sorted(). They make the code more concise and readable when a full function definition is not necessary.

I also learned Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Python. OOP is a programming paradigm that organizes code using classes and objects. A class is a blueprint for creating objects, and an object is an instance of a class. The __init__ method works as a constructor and is automatically called when an object is created. The self keyword refers to the current instance of the class and is used to access variables and methods inside the class. I also learned about inheritance, which allows one class (child class) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (parent class). This helps in code reusability and better program structure.
